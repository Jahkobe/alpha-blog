Lyrical by Jacob Pursell


For my project I wanted to be able to create a space for artists to be able to share ideas and have a creative area online where they can thrive and feel comfortable. So I came up with the idea to have an app for bands, poets, and artists to be able to share their work and get ideas from other artists about what they are writing and working on. It is an app called (lyrical) where you can write your lyrics, take a break and then continue working on them later. And in the process you can look at other peoples lyrics and get inspiration/ find a form that fits your style.

In this app you can write your own lyrics or poems and then save them to your profile/site. The catch is that everything is public. There is no reason to be scared at what you're doing artistically. You can view everyone's lyrics and take inspiration from them or just come back to your own and edit or even delete them at any time you want. You can easily customize your profile by adding a profile picture using gravatar which will automatically upload pictures associated with accounts with their emails. 


Authentication:
The most important part was to be able to have an authentication system so that you could write your lyrics and no one would be able to mess with them. Also in case there are disputes about “first use” so that no one is able to steal your work. So there I built a login system that once you are logged in you can create your lyrics page as well as edit them and your profile. You can only edit your own lyrics. If you're not logged in you can only view the lyrics and not actually create, edit, or destroy anything.

-Admin, along with authentication there is also the admin feature of the app which allows certain users to become an administrator with certain permissions. This gives them the ability to delete whoevers lyrics or accounts that they see fit.

Future Ideas
In the future I would like to add categories so that you can categorize different genres of songs and be able to add your own songs to a certain genre. I’d also like to make a public and private feature where you can either put your lyrics out there for the public to see it or just keep it private to yourself for the time being. Id also like to add a feature where you can upload your music associated with the lyrics or even upload music/covers to other people's music.
